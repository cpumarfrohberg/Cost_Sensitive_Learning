Course outline:
1. Intro
- what are imbalanced datasets
- what are problems arising when using imbalanced datasets
2. Using cost-sensitive methods for attending class imbalance
3. Using ROC AUC as a metric for evaluating performance
4. Course summary

Comments
- prio 1:
=> discuss different metrics - main focus being layed on ROC AUC (WICHTIG: ask if they have seen this topic in the course!)
=> practice the code (by heart)
=> include Confusion Matrices
=> see "Clarify" below

(=> make a presentation out of it)

- prio 2:
=> refactoring
=> including f1-score as a metric
=> run an ANN
=> make a more interesting intro 
    - bring up examples of what imbalanced datasets look like (as well as viz) - i.e. different relationships between datapoints of each class and implications
    - discuss where "distortions" might come from when talking about imbalanced datasets (from the business point of view, but especially re "FP" and "FN". Also: include dataset size, label noise, data distribution)
    - show how accuracy is a misleading metric (but in a different way than they already did in the course)
=> after presenting yourself, as well as indicating what will be discussed: indicate sources of materials used


Clarify:
=> why is there no split in this case? (compare also with NB in bootcamp, most prob. LogReg or LinReg, re this: they didn't split there either) => this is due to cv
=> understand intuition behind cost function (Ng! especially log effect as well as why formula starts with "-"; in addition: does the cost function actually include the "min"?)
=> memorize definitions of all metrics (aside from ROC AUC)
- where is the link to "regularization"?

(=> difference between true positives and false positives
- true positives are the right predictions of minority class 
- false positives are the wrong predictions of minority class) 

Clarify with Marija:
=> ROC AUC (WICHTIG: ask if they have seen this topic in the course!). More generally: what is it that they saw regarding this topic?
=> present course outline
=> Should I code live?
